-   This is a offical repo for **SketchHealer:** **A** **Graph-to-Sequence** **Network** **for** **Recreating** **Partial** **Human** **Sketches**
-   paper is [here](https://qugank.github.io/papers/SketchHealer.pdf)

-   To run this code, you need to install 
    -   pytorch
    -   torchvision
    -   opencv
    -   pillow
    -   and some common dependency libraries.

## Dataset
download from https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset

## Training

-   modify your data location and categories in hyper_params.py

-   ```sh
    python -u sketch_gcn.py
    ```

-   then, model starts training.

## Inference
